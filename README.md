# auto_weather_prediction
The program allows us to understand how the weather is today.

The temperature ranges are added respectively
                      
                  Very Cold [-40,0)
                  
                  Cold      [0,10)
                  
                  Normal    [10,20)
                  
                  Hot       [20, 30)
                  
                  Very Hot [30, 50)
                  
 
 Otherwise, it prints "Out of range".
